# VibrationSensor
Vibration Sensor interfacing project for ECE484.

This interfacing project uses an Arduino Uno to read the input from a Vibration Sensor (SW-420).

The code given in this repository will count the number of times the chip outputs a digital high signal (1) to a LCD screen. The chip will ouput a digital high signal when it is bumped, tapped, or shaken with a sufficient amount of force, which can be adjusted by the potentiometer on the chip.

## Operation
to run the code, wire the circuit as shown in the wiring diagram.
